# Firebase laboratory

This repository contains my first Android app using Google Firebase. It is a copy of [firebase/quickstart-android](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-android) with slight modifications done as indicated on [Firebase Android Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-android/#0).

To run this application, it is necessary to create a [Google Firebase account](https://firebase.google.com/), create a google-services json file and copy it to "app" folder. By the time this project was created, the creation of a Firebase account was free (I hope it still is!).
